# GPT-SoVITS Analysis Document

## Overview
GPT-SoVITS is a powerful few-shot voice conversion and text-to-speech system that can be trained with minimal voice data (as little as 1 minute).

## Key Features
1. **Zero-shot TTS**
   - Can convert text to speech with just a 5-second vocal sample
   - Instant conversion without training

2. **Few-shot TTS**
   - Requires only 1 minute of training data
   - Improved voice similarity and realism through fine-tuning

3. **Cross-lingual Support**
   - Supports English, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, and Chinese
   - Can perform inference in languages different from training data

4. **Built-in Tools**
   - Voice accompaniment separation
   - Automatic training set segmentation
   - Chinese/English/Japanese ASR
   - Text labeling tools

## Technical Requirements
1. **Environment Requirements**
   - Python 3.9/3.10
   - PyTorch 2.0.1+ (CUDA 11+) or 2.1.2+ (CUDA 12.3)
   - Apple Silicon support available
   - CPU-only deployment possible

2. **Dependencies**
   - FFmpeg
   - numba==0.56.4 (requires Python < 3.11)
   - See requirements.txt for full list

3. **Pretrained Models Required**
   - Main GPT-SoVITS models
   - G2PW models (for Chinese TTS)
   - UVR5 models (for voice separation)
   - ASR models (language-specific)

## Integration Considerations
1. **API Integration**
   - Requires WebUI setup for full functionality
   - Can be run via command line for automation
   - Supports both web interface and programmatic access

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - GPU recommended for optimal performance
   - Mac training quality issues noted (CPU recommended for Mac)
   - Memory requirements: minimum 16GB (Docker setup)

3. **Limitations**
   - Training on Mac results in lower quality
   - Emotion control feature not implemented
   - Model size variations (tiny/larger) not yet available
   - Currently limited to 5k hours training data

## Implementation Plan
1. **Required Dependencies for Our Project**
   ```
   torch>=2.0.1
   numpy
   scipy
   librosa
   ffmpeg-python
   ```

2. **Integration Architecture**
   - Use REST API for non-real-time operations
   - Consider WebSocket for real-time voice processing
   - Implement proper error handling for model loading/processing

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Model files size management
   - API rate limiting
   - Input validation for audio files
